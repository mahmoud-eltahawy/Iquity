# Iquity
A cross-platform markdown compiler.

## Why should I use it?
- âœ¨ Over 30 themes. âœ¨
- ðŸ¦‹ Beautiful UI - Tailwind and DaisyUI. ðŸ¦‹
- ðŸ“‚ PDF Export - Printable markdown preview. ðŸ“‚
- ðŸ¦€ Rusty - Built with Rust, frontend and backend. ðŸ¦€

## How is it made?
- [Leptos](https://www.leptos.dev) - A web application framework.
- [Tauri](https://www.tauri.app) - A desktop application framework.
- [Tailwind](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - A CSS framework.
- [DaisyUI](https://www.daisyui.com) - A Tailwind CSS component library.

## how is this different from Ubiquity

- Ubiquity ships it's own text editor side by side with the previewer while iquity trys to be minimal by watching the file your editing with your favourite text editor and hot reloads it's content every time you change some thing in it
- Ubiqity is using yew while iquity using leptos
- some other minimal differencs you will notice while using it but as development goes on. the two projects will become very different
