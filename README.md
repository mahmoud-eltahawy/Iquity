## how to use it
```bash
  iquity # will print help messge
  # you should use it like this
  iquity PATH_TO_README_FILE.md

## how is this different from Ubiquity
- Ubiquity ships it's own text editor side by side with the previewer while iquity trys to be minimal by watching the file you are editing with your favourite text editor and hot reloads it's content every time you change some thing in it
- Ubiqity is using **Yew** while iquity using **Leptos**
- some other minimal differencs you will notice while using it but as development goes on. the two projects will become very different

## todos
- [X] **ADD**: slides feature
- [X] **ADD**: a toml config file
- [X] **ADD**: keybindings to config
- [ ] **FIX BUG** : some editors remove and retouch the file it edits and notify crate has surprising behavior for that on some platforms
